 	<h2> AFODISE: WHAT IS IT?</h2>
<p>
"You come and see" is the literal meaning of the word “Afodise” in Ibibio (one of the about 450 indigenous languages spoken in Nigeria).

African Foundation for Development of Infrastructure and Social Services in Communities (AFODISE) began operating informally as a family charity as far back as 1955. It is now a non-governmental, not-for-profit, non-political, organisation formally registered with the Nigerian Corporate Affairs Commission, registration number 10306.  

The focus of our activities revolve around usefully harnessing, mobilising, and enhancing the largely untapped energies and resources of the rural people in pursuit of establishing sustainable development of basic infrastructure and social service that will put the people at the centre and aim at improving their quality of life in all perspectives.

It is the belief of AFODISE that whatever development made should be sustainable and should meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
